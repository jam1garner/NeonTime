### How to Install:

1. Jailbreak iOS device
2. Install XenHTML
3. Download NeonTime from the releases tab (Or download the repository as zip)
4. Copy the zip over to /var/mobile/Library/LockHTML
5. Unzip (I'd suggest using filza to download/move/unzip)

It should in the end look like:

```
/var/mobile/Library/LockHTML
    L NeonTime [Folder]
        L LockBackground.html
        L style.css     
        L time_keeper.js
```
